## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1) Safari:
   - Data is synced between my ios and Mac 
   - Passwords are automatically autofilled 
   
2) Instagram:
   - Being able to share photos easily
   - Ability to find other accounts that post interesting or funnt content
   
3) Youtube
  - Generally suggests content I find interesting
  - Entertainment without a monthly subscription fee
  
4) Spotify 
  - Easily able to find all of my favorite music and artists
  - Has podcasts and comedy in addition to music
  - Able to organize my music into playlists

I would like to create an app to help Amazon sellers and sellers on other online marketplace such as Ebay,Stock X, and others. This app would be able to scan the bar code of a product or have a product lookup that would tell the user if there is an arbitrage oppurtunity on those marketplaces. Additonally, the app could be geared to new sellers by recommending if the item would be a good product for them based on some criteria. Criteria could be user defined, or include sales volume, profit margin, how many other sellers are trying to sell the product, etc.

## Notes

It took me some time to navigate through Xcode because of my lack of familiarity using it.
